Perfect, Kavin! Let’s put everything together into a **full, polished, department-ready Requirement Analysis document** for your mini project. I’ll structure it **professionally**, including all concepts, algorithms, tech stack, data, grey-box design, and constraints/limitations.

# **Requirement Analysis Document**

**Project Title:**
**“An Explainable ML-Based System for False Positive Filtering in Financial Transactions”**

---

## **1. Introduction / Project Overview**

Financial institutions increasingly rely on automated fraud detection systems to prevent losses. However, legitimate transactions are often **incorrectly flagged as fraudulent (False Positives, FP)**, disrupting user experience and customer trust.

Currently, there is **no standardized tool** to explain why transactions are flagged as FPs. Existing systems are either proprietary or partially transparent.

**Objective:**

* Build a **grey-box, explainable ML-based system** that filters False Positives.
* Provide **feature-level explanations** for analysts to validate transactions.
* Restrict access to specified individuals while maintaining **confidentiality**.
* Standardize FP flagging for practical use in fintech environments.

**Key Considerations:**

* Identify which data is accessible to White / Grey / Black box users.
* Provide a clear overview of FP patterns, historical fraud patterns, and explainable ML decisions.

---

## **2. Core Concepts Needed**

1. **Transaction Definition**

   * Financial activity with features: ID, amount, timestamp, source/destination account, device, geolocation, channel.

2. **Transaction Confusion Matrix**

   * TP, FP, TN, FN — FP is the main focus.

3. **Patterns to Detect**

   * Fraud patterns: high-frequency transactions, unusual amounts, geolocation anomalies, device mismatch, OTP manipulation.
   * False positive patterns: large but normal transactions, rare merchant transactions, duplicate flagged transactions.

4. **Flagging Mechanisms**

   * Rule-based: thresholds, blacklist/whitelist.
   * ML-based: model scores, risk scoring, threshold optimization.
   * Grey-box: partial insights visible to analysts only.

---

## **3. Historical Fraud Transactions and Patterns**

1. **Credit/Debit Card Fraud:** stolen/cloned cards, card-not-present transactions.
2. **Account Takeover:** phishing, fake login portals, credential theft.
3. **Online Banking Fraud:** OTP interception, fake apps, session hijacking.
4. **Money Laundering / Structuring:** multiple small transfers to hide total amount.
5. **Anomalies:** high-value purchase in unusual location, rapid micro-transactions.

---

## **4. Sorting and Filtering FP Patterns**

* Sort FP patterns by frequency, transaction amount, customer segment, time, and location.
* Use sorted FP patterns to guide **feature selection**, ML training, and threshold tuning.
* Helps analysts focus on **high-probability false positives**.

---

## **5. Machine Learning Algorithms**

**Baseline / Interpretable Models:**

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Ensemble / High-Performance Models:**
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

**Anomaly Detection / Rare Cases:**
6. Isolation Forest
7. One-Class SVM
8. Autoencoder (optional, advanced)

**Threshold Optimization / Cost-Sensitive Learning:**

* Adjust thresholds to control FP rates according to business needs.

---

## **6. Supporting Algorithms (DSA)**

1. Sorting & searching (timestamps, amounts)
2. Hashing / dictionaries (fast historical lookup)
3. Queues / stacks (alert workflow management)
4. Graph traversal / link analysis (optional, multi-account fraud detection)

* Maintain confidentiality while providing **interpretable outputs**.
* Aligns with real-world fintech practices.
* Access may be **restricted further by internal client policies** (optional detail).

## **12. Project Constraints / Limitations**

1. **FP Focus Only:**

   * The project is limited to **False Positive filtering**.
   * TP, TN, and FN optimization is **out of scope**, as it would require redesigning primary fraud detection models.

2. **Partial Explainability (Grey-Box):**

   * Analysts see **only safe feature-level explanations**; full model internals remain hidden.
   * Explainability is **“partial-of-partial”**, reflecting real-world fintech confidentiality constraints.

3. **Optional Note:**

   * Future work could expand to **full confusion matrix optimization** while maintaining explainability, which could evolve into a capstone-level project.
