# 🎯 Should You Do Full SRS Now?

Short answer:

👉 **No. Don’t rush full SRS this week.**

Here’s why:

Right now:

* Your idea just evolved.
* Architecture clarity is still stabilizing.
* You haven’t deeply explored:

  * SHAP mechanics
  * XGBoost internals
  * How false positive patterns will be identified
  * Feedback storage structure

If you write full SRS now:

* You’ll lock yourself into decisions.
* Later learning may contradict your written requirements.
* You’ll end up revising everything.

That’s risky.

# 🧠 Smart Strategy

### This Week:

✔ Submit only Product Overview (strict SRS format)
✔ Keep scope controlled
✔ Learn deeply about:

* SHAP value interpretation
* Fraud dataset structure
* How case review systems work
* Model retraining pipelines

### Next Week:

Then expand into:

* Functional Requirements
* Non-Functional Requirements
* System Architecture
* Data Flow Diagram

That’s professional pacing.

You chose Option 2 (learn + write overview now).

So here it is.

# 📄 PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Strict SRS Format)

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The proposed system, titled **“An Explainable ML-Based System for False Positive Filtering in Financial Transactions,”** is designed as an integrated post-transaction analytical module that operates alongside an existing Machine Learning–based fraud detection system.

The system does not perform primary fraud detection and does not replace or override the core fraud prediction engine. Instead, it functions as a secondary explainability-driven analysis layer that processes already flagged transactions to assist in identifying potential false positive cases.

The system leverages SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model decisions and provide structured insight into feature-level contributions that influenced the fraud classification.

---

### 2.2 Product Functions

The primary functions of the system include:

1. Accept flagged transaction data from an existing ML-based fraud detection model.
2. Generate SHAP-based explanations for each flagged transaction.
3. Identify and highlight key feature contributions influencing the fraud prediction.
4. Analyze contribution patterns to support identification of potential false positive cases.
5. Present explainability results in a structured analytical format for review.
6. Store analyst feedback for future model retraining and improvement processes.

The system does not:

* Generate independent fraud predictions.
* Modify or override the original fraud classification.
* Interact with live transaction streams.

---

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

**Primary User: Fraud Analyst**

* Reviews flagged transactions.
* Interprets SHAP-based explanations.
* Identifies possible false positives.
* Provides feedback for model refinement.

**Secondary User: Academic Demonstration User**

* Uses the system for evaluation and simulation purposes.
* Observes explanation patterns and system workflow.

---

### 2.4 Operating Environment

The system will operate in a controlled prototype environment with the following configuration:

* Programming Language: Python
* Machine Learning Framework: XGBoost
* Explainability Library: SHAP
* Interface: Jupyter Notebook–based analytical interface
* Deployment Mode: Offline simulation / prototype environment

The system is not intended for real-time production deployment.

---

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

* The system relies on outputs from an existing fraud detection model.
* The system does not access real-time transaction streams.
* The system does not perform automated decision override.
* The system is limited to false positive analytical review and feedback support.

---

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

* It is assumed that an existing ML-based fraud detection model provides flagged transaction data.
* It is assumed that transaction feature data required for SHAP explanation is accessible.
* It is assumed that analyst feedback can be stored for future model retraining.
