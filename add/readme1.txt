Explainable ML-Based False Positive Transaction Filtering System
Fraudulent transactions can occur not only through physical theft of bank account details but also via digital means such as phishing links, fake login portals, OTP manipulation, and exploitation of vulnerable banking servers during transactions. To mitigate fi nancial loss and maintain customer trust, fi ntech companies employ rule-based and automated fraud detection systems to identify and block suspicious transactions.
However, fraud detection systems operate under the transaction confusion matrix comprising True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives. Among these, False Positives, where legitimate transactions are incorrectly blocked, pose a signifi cant challenge as they disrupt genuine users and negatively impact customer experience. Strict rule-based verifi cation mechanisms often result in both sender and receiver accounts being blocked, leading to transaction complexity and dissatisfaction.
Traditional approaches adopted by fi nancial institutions to reduce false positives rely on manually engineered rules and transaction parameters, achieving a reduction rate of approximately 50–60%. With the advancement of Artifi cial Intelligence, Machine Learning–based detection models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Isolation Forests have been introduced, signifi cantly improving fraud detection accuracy and reducing false positives to nearly 90%.
Despite these improvements, a critical limitation persists in the form of lack of explainability. Most ML-based systems function as black-box models, producing risk scores without consistently explaining the underlying reasons for fl agging transactions. This lack of transparency, combined with model-specifi c behavior and inconsistent interpretation across systems, limits effective false-positive resolution.
To address this gap, this project proposes an ML-Based False Positive Filtering System that acts as an explainable fi ltering layer over existing fraud detection models. The system analyzes transaction behavior, historical patterns, and risk indicators to distinguish legitimate transactions from
